# File Upload Issue - Resolved

## Problem Summary

We identified and fixed an issue with our teaching material submission form where users couldn't upload large files (like PowerPoint presentations or PDF documents over 4.5MB).

## What Was Wrong

Our hosting provider (Vercel) has a built-in limit that prevents large files from being uploaded through our website. When users tried to submit materials with large files, the form would fail without showing a clear error message.

## What We Fixed

We've implemented a new upload system that:

- **Allows large files** - Users can now upload files up to 100MB
- **Shows progress** - Users can see the upload progress in real-time
- **Better error messages** - Clear feedback if something goes wrong
- **Same user experience** - The form looks and works exactly the same

## Technical Details

Instead of sending files through our website server (which has size limits), files now go directly to our content management system. This bypasses the size restrictions while maintaining all security and functionality.

## Result

✅ Large file uploads now work properly  
✅ Better user experience with progress indicators  
✅ No impact on existing functionality  
✅ More reliable submission process  

The fix is now live and ready for testing. Users should no longer experience issues when uploading large teaching materials.

## Next Steps

Please test the submission form with various file sizes to confirm everything is working as expected. Let me know if you encounter any issues or have questions.
